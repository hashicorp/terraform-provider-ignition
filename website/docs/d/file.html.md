# ignition\_file

Describes a file to be written in a particular filesystem.

## Example Usage

File with inline content:

```hcl
data "ignition_file" "hello" {
	path = "/hello.txt"
	content {
		content = "Hello World!"
	}
}
```

File with remote content:

```hcl
data "ignition_file" "hello" {
	path = "/hello.txt"
	source {
		source = "http://example.com/hello.txt.gz"
		compression = "gzip"
		verification = "sha512-0123456789abcdef0123456789...456789abcdef"
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `path` - (Required) The absolute path to the file.

* `overwrite` - (Optional) Whether to delete preexisting nodes at the path. Defaults to false.

* `content` - (Optional) Block to provide the file content inline.

* `source` - (Optional) Block to retrieve the file content from a remote location.

	__Note__: `content` and `source` are mutually exclusive.

* `mode` - (Optional) The file's permission mode. Note that the mode must be properly specified as a decimal value, not octal (i.e. 0755 -> 493).

* `uid` - (Optional) The user ID of the owner.

* `gid` - (Optional) The group ID of the owner.

The `content` block supports:

* `mime` - (Required) MIME format of the content (default _text/plain_).

* `content` - (Required) Content of the file.

The `source` block supports:

* `source` - (Required) The URL of the file contents. Supported schemes are http, https, tftp, s3, and [data][rfc2397]. When using http, it is advisable to use the verification option to ensure the contents haven't been modified.

* `compression` - (Optional) The type of compression used on the contents (null or gzip). Compression cannot be used with S3.

* `verification` - (Optional) The hash of the config, in the form _\<type\>-\<value\>_ where type is either sha512 or sha256. If compression is specified, the hash describes the decompressed file.

* `http_headers` - (Optional) A list of HTTP headers to be added to the request.

The `http_headers` blocks support:

* `name` - (Required) The header name.

* `value` - (Required) The header contents.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `rendered` - The rendered template to reference this resource in _ignition_config_.
